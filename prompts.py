Net income climbed 2.9 percent, to $145.5 million, or 51 cents a share, matching analyst estimates. Revenue in the three months that ended Aug. 26 increased 12 percent, to $1.61 billion, the company, based in Union, N.J., said yesterday. Sales at stores open at least a year gained 4.8 percent, up from 4.5 percent a year earlier and beating analystsâ€™ estimates. The company also said that an independent board committee had begun a voluntary review of stock option grants and that it would report further on the review in its quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Oct. 5. More than 130 companies have disclosed internal or federal investigations into possible irregularities in the way they paid executives with options."""

To successfully complete the task, do the following in order. Do not move onto the next instruction without completing the previous one. Give the keywords in json only after completing all the other instructions:

1) Read your task and the webpage text carefully.
2) Summarize the text.
3) Think about what is contained in the text and what questions it answers.
4) Focus on the questions that are being answered in most of the text.
5) Based on those questions, come up with candidates for key phrases that text gives information about. 
6) Ensure the key phrases follow the guidelines provided below.
7) Select the final key phrases.
8) Output the key phrases in JSON format.

The guidelines phrases should follow are:

1) Provide the phrases in JSON format, with each key phrase being an item in a list. The list name is "key_phrases".
2) Use at most 10 key phrases. You can use less than that.
3) Key phrases should be quite short, about 1-3 words.
4) Ensure the key phrases are distinct from each other, avoiding synonyms or phrases with the same meaning.
5) The phrases are based on information that the text provides.
6) Prioritize the phrases that are present in the majority of the text over those that are present just in one part.
7) Start the json block with ```json and end it with ```.
