Net income climbed 2.9 percent, to $145.5 million, or 51 cents a share, matching analyst estimates. Revenue in the three months that ended Aug. 26 increased 12 percent, to $1.61 billion, the company, based in Union, N.J., said yesterday. Sales at stores open at least a year gained 4.8 percent, up from 4.5 percent a year earlier and beating analystsâ€™ estimates. The company also said that an independent board committee had begun a voluntary review of stock option grants and that it would report further on the review in its quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Oct. 5. More than 130 companies have disclosed internal or federal investigations into possible irregularities in the way they paid executives with options."""

2) Use at most 10 key phrases. You can use less than that.
3) Key phrases should be quite short, about 1-3 words.
4) Ensure the key phrases are distinct from each other, avoiding synonyms or phrases with the same meaning.
5) Select key phrases that are mentioned multiple times on the webpage, directly or trough context. Avoid phrases that appear only once.
